SDLCast
-------

This is a simple Wolfenstein-style raycasting engine that uses SDL. I'd always wanted to implement one
as a quick learning project.

TODO
====

- Fix weird rendering up close
- Stop making a needless copy when casting
- Add optional floor and ceiling rendering
- Add optional skybox
- Make tuning pass
- Improve makefile
